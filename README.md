Brain Stroke Diagnosis System (BSDS)
Overview
The Brain Stroke Diagnosis System (BSDS) is a diagnostic tool developed to assist in the detection of ischemic strokes in brain MRI scans. Utilizing the advanced YOLOv8 model for object detection, BSDS identifies ischemic regions efficiently and accurately, providing critical support for healthcare professionals in making timely diagnoses and improving patient care.

Features
Ischemic Stroke Detection: BSDS is tailored specifically for detecting ischemic strokes, one of the most common types of strokes, directly from MRI images.
Fast and Reliable: Built with YOLOv8, BSDS offers rapid detection, which is essential for urgent cases where time-sensitive decision-making is required.
User-Friendly Design: With a simple setup and clear instructions, BSDS is accessible to both medical professionals and researchers.
Project Motivation
Ischemic strokes require quick and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment, yet detecting these strokes from MRI images can be challenging. BSDS was developed to support medical imaging by using deep learning to improve diagnostic speed and accuracy. The project is a step forward in leveraging AI to make medical care more efficient and effective.

Installation
To set up BSDS on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:

bash
نسخ الكود
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BSDS.git
cd BSDS
Install Dependencies: BSDS requires Python 3.x and other dependencies. Install them using:

bash
نسخ الكود
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up YOLOv8: Make sure you have YOLOv8 properly configured for the detection process. Refer to YOLOv8’s official documentation if needed.

Usage
Upload MRI Data: Place your brain MRI scans in the designated input_data folder.

Run Detection:

bash
نسخ الكود
python detect_strokes.py
The script will process each MRI scan and provide detection results indicating any ischemic regions.

View Results: The detection output will be saved in the output folder, where detected ischemic regions will be highlighted.

Future Development
BSDS is a project in active development with plans to:

Enhance detection accuracy by expanding the dataset and refining model parameters.
Improve speed and usability to fit diverse medical imaging applications.
Participate in scientific exhibitions like ISEF, showcasing BSDS as an innovative healthcare tool.
